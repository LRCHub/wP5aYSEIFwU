Maybe it's a little bit rushed,
but I'm falling in love
Hope that's not too much,
but this isn't a crush
I've done that enough,
girl, I know that it's real
It's like you fell down from
Heaven (Oh, no)
Oh, I've been waiting forever
(So long)
And I know we can do this together
(It's only you and me)
How do you feel?
Is it anything like I feel?
(Yes or no?)
Is it anything like I feel?
(Let me know)
Or should I chill?
How do you feel?
Is it anything like I feel?
(Although)
Is it anything like I feel?
(Although)
Maybe you might think it's untrue,
but I'm falling for you
My mind is a mess,
girl, don't know what to do
All of this pressure
I'm feeling inside
Ain't this supposed to be painless?
Then why am I so anxious?
I wish we could do this together
(It's only you and me)
How do you feel?
Is it anything like I feel?
(Yes or no?)
Is it anything like I feel?
(Let me know)
Or should I chill?
How do you feel?
Is it anything like I feel?
(Although)
Is it anything like I feel?
(Although, yes or no?)
You were there for everything
That came along with being true
You did a lot of things
you wouldn't normally do
While I appreciate
how much you give to others
Can't help but wonder, oh
Would they do the same for you?
Girl, you're truly a one-of-one
(Superwoman)
But remember to take care of number one
(Somehow you're perfect,
but don't try to be)
Girl, you're truly a one-of-one
(You're the last of your kind)
But remember to take care of number one
(For what it's worth,
girl, you inspire me)
You are, are Superwoman
(Somehow you're perfect,
but don't try to be)
And you're the last of your kind
(For what's it's worth,
girl, you inspire me)
Yeah, you know, know, know
that you're Superwoman
(Somehow you're perfect,
but don't try to be)
You're a dying breed
(You're the last of your kind)
For what it's worth,
girl, you inspire me
