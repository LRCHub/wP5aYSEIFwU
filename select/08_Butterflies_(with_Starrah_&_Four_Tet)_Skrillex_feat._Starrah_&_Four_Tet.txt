Everybody loves somebody
I know you're not just anybody
Butterflies when you touch my body
Electric love baby shock me, shock me

Been here before
Lit like the fourth
When you hit my door
No fallin short
Tease it
Please it
Squeeze it
Flip 180 degrees it

Cause everybody loves somebody
But I know you're not anybody
Butterflies when you touch my body
Electric love baby shock me, shock me

Lips on my lips
Hands on grip
You know you want this, mhmm
Oh you want this yeah
Tease it
Please it
Squeeze it
Keep it, keep it, keep it

Cause everybody loves somebody
But I know you're not anybody
Butterflies when you touch my body
Electric love baby shock me shock me

Everybody loves somebody
I know you're not just anybody
Butterflies when you touch my body
Electric love baby shock me, shock me
