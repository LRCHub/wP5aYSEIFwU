Here I go, I'm gonna start an anthem
For all my girls who've gone and blew their chances
And now, now they suck on a cigarette

I was bored, I got a little distracted
To add it up, I got a little subtracted from you
Now this bottle lays empty on the carpet where you slept

Gonna cry to the bottom of my heart
I never thought, never thought that it'd be so hard
I'm freaking out but I don't really care
You're someplace else and I don't care

'Cause I believe in butterflies
I believe I told some lies
I'm holding on to all I had
I'm saying sorry boy, I was bad

So kiss me on the tip of my naked eye
Don't really wanna, really wanna say goodbye
I'll go to hell some other day
But trust me, baby, it'll be okay

My thumb was on your head, I felt like a goddess
But the truth is I was so fucking heartless
And you, you call me on all I do, what have I done?

Gonna bash my head against the mirror
Close my eyes and cut all my hair off, it's true
Maybe you'll understand just what I'm going through

Gonna sing at the top of my sweet lungs
Come back, come back to where you belong
I'm freaking out but I don't really care
You're someplace else and I'm not there

I believe in butterflies
I believe I told some lies
I'm holding on to all I had
I'm saying sorry boy, I was bad

So kiss me on the tip of my naked eye
Don't really wanna, really wanna say goodbye
I'll go to hell some other day
But trust me, baby, it'll be okay

What's yours is mine
What's mine is yours
Well, can't we go back
To how we were before?

I believe in butterflies
I believe I told some lies
I'm holding on to all I had
I'm saying sorry boy, I was bad

So kiss me on the tip of my naked eye
Don't really wanna, really wanna say goodbye
I'll go to hell some other day
But trust me, baby, it'll be okay

I believe, I believe
I'm holding on to all I had
I'm saying sorry boy, I was bad
