I see the stars,
Coming right through your skin.
I'll have a drink before my shift begins
I see your eyes, filled with amazement
I love your eyes, they're so amazing

I don't know why,
I feel that we could jive.
It feels good,
To know that i'm alive.
And for a day,
I waited right by the phone.
Nobody told me,
It sucks to be alone.
